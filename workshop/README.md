### Computational & Expanded ███ography
[Golan Levin](http://flong.com) / [@golan](http://twitter.com/golan) <br />
A one-week workshop taught at Anderson Ranch, July 2016<br />
Initially developed Fall 2015 at Carnegie Mellon University<br />
For complete info, see the [**Experimental Capture main page**](../README.md).

### Learning Objectives

This workshop introduces some experimental media practices that arise from using devices to "capture" the world. In particular, we are concerned with how we can understand and build representations of the world using devices that sense beyond the limits of human perception.
