A one-week workshop taught at Anderson Ranch, July 2016<br />
Initially developed Fall 2015 at Carnegie Mellon University<br />

### Learning Objectives

This workshop introduces some experimental media practices that arise from using devices to "capture" the world. In particular, we are concerned with how we can understand and build representations of the world using devices that sense beyond the limits of human perception.

### Tuesday  

Today's topic is seeing beyond human perception, with: **Multi-spectral imaging** (NIR, UV, Thermal) and **High-speed videography**. We will also look at other forms of **time play**.  

1. Interludes and Appetizers
	* [Gonioreflectometry](../docs/gonioreflectometry.md)
	* [Synthesis from Image Databases](../docs/collection-synthesis.md)
1. Main topics: 
	* [Multispectral & Hyperspectral Imaging](../docs/hyperspectral.md)
	* [Overcranking (Slow-Motion/Hi-Speed)](../docs/overcranking.md)
1. Time Play (Part 1)
	* [Bullet Time (Array Videography)](../docs/bullettime.md)
	* [Undercranking and Time Lapse](../docs/undercranking.md)
	* [Long Exposure and Light Painting](../docs/longexposure.md)

#### Activities and Exercises

1. We will have demonstrations of IR, Thermal, and UV videography. 
1. We will have demonstrations of the Edgertronic high speed camera. Here's the Edgertronic [Beginner's Guide to High-Speed Video](http://wiki.edgertronic.com/index.php/Beginner's_Guide_to_High_Speed_Video), which may be helpful if you want to know more. 
1. Participants are free to work with any of the above.
