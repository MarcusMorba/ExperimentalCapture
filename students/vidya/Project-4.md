The thermal camera is a pretty awesome tool, Its pretty neat that reflections can be seen so clearly on plain glass.I took a lot of footage of me walking around campus and its cool to see blobs of heat everywhere (students).If I had more time I would have loved to capture reflection of the city on the sea through thermal camera, I think that would be a cool experimentation.
