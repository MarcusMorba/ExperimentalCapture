#Lidar Photography (cont'd)

###*Final Project, In Progress*

*Horizontal Static Scanning*

At the recommendation of Golan, I scanned the entrance to Doherty Hall, right before class got out. The lidar was positioned such that the scan fanned our horizontally, parallel to the ground plane, at about chest height. This time, the extrusion is not horizontal, but vertical through time.

Each of the snake-like forms represents the path of one person. Though the forms that arise on the order of seconds are interesting, even more so are those which accumulate over an hour.

The paths we collectively take are visualized. The structure of our environment and our relationship to it becomes apparent.
