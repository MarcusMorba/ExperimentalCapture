# Trace Ribbon - An Emmergence By Movement
##Looking Outwards 10/16

###Overview
[Trace Ribbon](http://www.creativeapplications.net/openframeworks/trace-ribbon-an-emergence-by-movement/) records and responds to the participants movement using openFrameworks.  It was created by Shohei Fujimoto and is currently part of of the 21_21 exhibition 'Motion Science'.

###My Thoughts
I thought this was pretty cool. I liked how while the ribbon has its own character and movement, even though the height is taken from the participant. In one of the pictures it looked like there were two of these, and I think it could be interesting to have different interactions control them differently. Participants would have to experiment to figure out how to control the different versions, and it would be an interesting way to look at what users think is intuitive.

### Influences
Shohei Fujimoto has previously done work with mirrors and light, and manipulating the desktop. The desktop application was also in openFrameworks, so it seems to be something Fujimoto uses often and is comfortable with.
