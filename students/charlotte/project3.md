## War Flying


###Research
The definition of Wardriving from Wikipedia - 

"**Wardriving** is the act of searching for Wi-Fi wireless networks by a person in a moving vehicle, using a portable computer, smartphone or personal digital assistant (PDA)."

The modes of travel listed for wardriving included: walking, jogging, biking & railing. 

It was missing flying!

Routers can be in higher places like the top floors of buildings and its strength would not reach the ground, or they could be placed in other locations that would be impossible to reach by any of the aforementioned techniques. 

So we did some research and found some other people that had the same idea, but it wasnt quite right:

###Past Works

**W.A.S.P.**

This guy was mande for Defcon 2010, and seems to be the only one of its kind. Since then there has been muliple innovations on UVAs. "The war-flying W.A.S.P. weighs about 13 pounds with a length of 76 inches and a wingspan of 67 inches. Rich said it has a flight time of approximately 30-45 minutes with a maximum estimated altitude of around 22,000 feet." So those are not your avg sized googly eyes. 

**From the [NSA](http://hackaday.com/2014/05/02/nsa-technology-goes-open-hardware/)**

This was released with a bunch of other highly classified files from the NSA. Its from a division called ANT (part of the NSA for making hardware), which was a cataloge of different equipment developed by ANT. This is called the SPARROW II system. Basically a WIFI sniffer on a drone, but it costs $6K

### But y?

Why should we care if someone can sniff WIFI?

In a perfect world you could leave your Wi-Fi networks wide open to share with any passing Wi-Fi starved travelers who desperately needed to check their email or lightly use your network, but with that comes the people who will ues your wifi to upload their morally reprehensible and/or illigal obsessions, or just use your bandwith unfairly. 

Why do we want to sniff WIFI?

We want to create this map and pair that with other maps and possibly see what group of people would use encryption and who wouldn't. Pittsburgh is home to many groups of different people, and how they treat their wifi can be indicative to the type of pserson who lives there.
