Through humorous animations, French photographer and animator Nicolas Monterrat transforms historical still captures and
paintings into surreal gifs. I am really interested in animation and I feel that by animating these ancient artifacts, these
paintings and photographs turn into various timeless/endless historical moments. Through clever digital manipulation, they 
become different methods of experimentally capturing experiences.

I think Nicolas is really good at repurposing the pieces that he transforms. However, I think some of the pieces are a lot
stronger than others. Although in all pieces, the viewer knows that the photo or painting has been manipulated, some pieces
create more believable animations by considering surrounding influences around the animation. 

His work reminds me of the more modern cinemagraphs (http://cinemagraphs.com/), which are cinematic gifs, often highlighting only one moving object. Cinemagraphs take advantage of both the timeless presence of the still photograph and the elegant gestures of a film.
