# Final Project Proposal
### Throwin' Around Some Ideas

I know I need to pick something that can be iterated on quickly, so I'm trying to think about what kinds of projects would work in and around the CMU campus.

I think time distortion is really cool! My favorite project we looked at in class is [DAWN CHORUS by Marcus Coates](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCCpnDtgxXk). I'm trying to think of what would be cool to see sped up or slowed down.

On Monday, Smokey and I talked about the possibility of working together. He had an interesting idea about temporally compressing sound by cutting a recording into chunks and overlaying them.

###Misc. list of my ideas

- Besides singing, are their other actions humans do that when sped up resemble small animals? What other kinds of distinctive bird songs would come through clearly?
- What would a slit-scanned time lapse look like?
- What if you had a cup whose interior is a small video view of another world?
