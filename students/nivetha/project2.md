###About
Any kids growing up in the 90s remembers Saturday morning cartoons. And any woman remembers that, of these cartoons, the 
magical girls were one of the most memorable. Though we joke that we’d like to be a sailor scout or a wielder of the clow 
cards we know that these girls have shaped the type of women we’ve become. We know that the genre, though littered with it’s 
own set of problems, is one that has empowered us by allowing us to believe that we too are magical girls.

This article describes in more detail just how important these shows were for girls in the 90s:
(note: We do not agree with all of this article particularily in that it makes magical girl animes seem like the epitome 
of female empowerment which it is NOT. However, the main idea is that it was revolutionary in the 90's when it was brought 
to the mainstream in the US).

###Summary
Our project uses Face OSC, Open CV, and Processing to help viewers experience five different types of magical girl 
transformations. These transformations stem from shows we feel encompass a variety of sub-genere within the overarching 
magical girls genre. This way, all types of girls and viewpoints are represented. We hope, by allowing viewers to experience 
these transformations, we help them become more able to express themselves and save the day which is in the heart of what the 
magical girl genre represented for girls growing in the 90s.

###Reflection
Through this project we hoped to pick at the idea of ‘transformation’ by using the mode of these various cartoons. Viewers- 
especially those who have admitted growing up with the magical girl genre- have demonstrated positive feeling towards the 
project saying it makes them feel like a ‘real magical girl.’ We feel we were successful in eliciting a response like this 
from people who grew up with this genre as these people were our intended audience. We tried to only keep the top half go each 
magical girls’ face because the bottom half made it seem too representational of the character. Unfortunately, we still may 
have reference these cartoons using the magical girl genre rather than referencing he magical girl genre by referencing these 
girls. In the future, we hop to grow the list of transformations included in this project because, right now, the small number
of transformations suggest a reason for choosing this small amount when there is not much reason at all for it.
