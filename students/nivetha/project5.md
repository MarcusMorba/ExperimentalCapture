### Summary
This uses multiple 360 videos shot from the viewpoint of objects around my house. Each object is one that I use often and, thus, are objects that 'know' me very well. This project puts viewers into the headspace of several objects in my apartment watching me in the setting and in the way they are used to - watching me progress in the mundane routines I am used to - brushing my teeth, organizing my space, changing clothes, etc. This project uses 360 videos to allow viewers to watch my mundane home experiences through the eyes and headspace of several different objects. The data presented in this project is second to the actual experience of the piece. As the subject of the piece I feel the largest point of interest for me is actually experiencing myself from the head of my objects ( I have to say, my objects must think I’m a grumpy, sad, lonely person) as well as an analysis of how I seem when I am in my home and performing mundane activities. Users Experience the peice through an ipad which they must move around to see the 360 video. this physicallity of the interaction and the unqueness of the experience allows viewers to really put themselves into the experience and relate to these objects in another level. Moreover, after watching the entire library of videos, users gain a new but still distant understanding of me personally.

### Potential VR 
 In the best case scenario, these videos will be available for viewers to watch using a google cardboard- they will be able to use Youtube’s new feature which allows 360 videos to be experienced in VR using compatible phones. Currently, the list of compatible phones that will allow this piece to be experienced in the way it was supposed to is small. However, more phones are projected to be able to use this technology and Apple seems to have plans to allow their phones to work with this technology. Until then, though, the piece is best viewed on a smart tablet like the iPad where viewers can move the iPad (viewport) around themselves to experience the piece. Moving the iPad gives a glimpses of the physicality this piece will ideally have with google cardboard.

### Reflection
A large amount of this project was trying to get the 360 camera to connect with my iPhone, trying to pretend there was no camera where I knew there was, and trying to find ways to use youtube’s new VR capabilities with the materials I could get my hands on. In the end, I had to settle for using an iPad, however, I’m confident the piece can be experienced in google cardboard in the near future as Google works to drive out it’s compatibility issues.
